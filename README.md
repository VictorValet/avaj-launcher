This repository hosts avaj-launcher, a post-Common Core project of 42 School.

avaj-launcher is a Java program that monitors the movement of aircrafts in a three-dimensional space. It takes as parameters a simple .txt file containing the number of movements the aircrafts will make and a list of aircrafts defined by their type, name, and the three-dimensional coordinates of their starting point.

Aside from being the first Java project I've ever done, the goal of this project was to explore some basics of software design such as UML, observers, factories, and singletons.

If you're a 42 student and you're passing by, don't hesitate to take a look but don't copy paste it (as you would lose the opportunity to learn and may reproduce some of my code's flaws).
